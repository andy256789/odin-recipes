   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place.
        This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. 
        What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet,
        but you'll finish the steak in the oven.
        The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks 
        with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender,
        perfectly cooked interior. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>2 cups orange juice</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>steak seasoning to taste</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish.
            Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. </li>
        <li>Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees C. </li>
        <li>Cover steaks with plastic wrap and
            let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Place steaks on a clean work surface and
            generously rub with steak seasoning. </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until
            lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook until browned on the other side and
            red in the center, about 2 minutes more. </li>
        <li>Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and
            reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
            the center should read from 54 degrees C to 60 degrees C. </li>
        <li>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. 
            Let rest for 5 minutes before serving. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
